Key Components of the Code:
Process class:

Represents each individual process (or player).

It extends the Thread class, meaning each process will run in its own thread concurrently with others.

Each process has a token, which gives it permission to enter the critical section (the special tent).

Token Management:

Each process can either hold the token (meaning it can enter the critical section) or pass it to the next process in a circular manner.

The token is passed to the next process after the current one finishes in the critical section.

Entering Critical Section:

When a process has the token and randomly decides it wants to enter the critical section, it simulates spending time there by sleeping for 2 seconds, then prints that it's entering and exiting the section.

Infinite Loop:

The while(true) loop ensures that each process keeps trying to request the critical section and passing the token around infinitely.

TokenRingSimulation class:

This is the main part of the program, where we create a ring of processes (an array of Process objects).

The first process (process 0) is given the token, and the other processes are started concurrently.

How the Code Works:
We have 5 processes (players).

Each process (player) will randomly decide whether to enter the critical section (tent).

The process with the token is the only one that can enter the critical section.

After entering the critical section, the process passes the token to the next player in the ring.

The game continues indefinitely, with processes randomly requesting to enter the critical section, using the token, and passing it along.

This is a simulation of a token ring system, where each process waits for the token to get into the critical section and then passes it along to the next process.
